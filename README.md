# VTParse - An implementation of Paul Williams' DEC compatible state machine parser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/astoeckel/vtparse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/astoeckel/vtparse)

Slightly "modernised" version of the [vtparse](https://github.com/haberman/vtparse) library originally created by Joshua Haberman. `vtparse` implements a (mostly) DEC compatible state machine described here: [http://www.vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser](http://www.vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser).

`vtparse` is useful when implementing terminal emulators for the VT100 and newer hardware terminals. The library is written in C89 and has zero dependencies, including the standard library (hence no `malloc`, `memset`, etc.).

The following changes were made to the library:

* **Cleaner code** (subjectively...)<br/>Moved private symbols out of the public header and prefixed all symbols with `vtparse_`. Errors and warnings in with modern Ruby were eliminated. Yielded to my borderline compulsive urge to add useless comments to the code.
* **Build system**<br/>Switched to the Meson build system; generated headers are included in the repository.
* **UTF-8 support**<br/>UTF-8 sequences are passed through in their entirety. Unfortunately, this means that the library is no longer DEC compatible, since 8-bit control characters no longer work. This should be irrelevant in modern applications.
* **Unit tests**<br/>
(*WORK IN PROGRESS*)
* **Return value based parsing**<br/>Eliminated the callback function. `vtparse_parse` returns whenever an event happens. `VTPARSE_ACTION_PUT` and `VTPARSE_ACTION_PRINT` do not trigger an event for each character, instead the corresponding byte range in the input buffer is indicated.


## Building

`vtparse` consists of two `.c` and `.h` files. It should correspondingly be quite straight-forward to integrate with your own project. Additionally, this project supports the Meson build system.

### Manual build

`vtparse` has zero dependencies; it solely consists of the files in the `vtparse` folder. You can for example compile the demo application by running
```
git clone https://github.com/astoeckel/vtparse
cd vtparse
gcc -std=c89 -Wall -o vtparse_example example/vtparse_example.c vtparse/vtparse.c vtparse/vtparse_table.c
echo -e "Hello\nWorld" ./vtparse_example
```

### Using meson

This project supports the Meson build system. To install Meson, run `pip3 install --user meson`. Meson furthermore depends on `ninja`. `ninja` (sometimes called `ninja-build`) should be provided by your Linux distribution. To build the library and run the tests run
```
git clone https://github.com/astoeckel/vtparse
cd vtparse && mkdir build && cd build
meson -Dbuildtype=release ..
ninja
ninja test
```
