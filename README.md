# VTParse - An implementation of Paul Williams' DEC compatible state machine parser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/astoeckel/vtparse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/astoeckel/vtparse)

Modernized version of Joshua Haberman's [vtparse](https://github.com/haberman/vtparse) library. `vtparse` implements an almost DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) compatible state machine described by Paul Williams. More information on the state machine can be found here: [http://www.vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser](http://www.vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser).

`vtparse` is useful when implementing terminal emulators for the VT100 and newer hardware terminals manufactured by DEC. The library is written in C89 and has zero dependencies; this includes no dependencies on the standard library (hence no `malloc`, `memset`, etc.). Correspondingly this code should easily run on embedded hardware without an operating system.

## New features

The following changes were made to the original library:

* **Cleaner code** (well, subjectively...)<br/>Moved private symbols out of the public header and prefixed all symbols with `vtparse_`. Errors and warnings with modern Ruby were eliminated. Gave in to my borderline compulsive urge to add useless comments to the code.
* **Build system**<br/>Switched to the Meson build system; generated headers are included in the repository.
* **UTF-8 support**<br/>UTF-8 sequences are passed through in their entirety. Unfortunately, this means that the library is no longer DEC compatible, since 8-bit control characters no longer work. This should be irrelevant in modern applications.
* **Unit tests**<br/>
(*WORK IN PROGRESS*)
* **Return value based parsing**<br/>Eliminated the callback function. `vtparse_parse` returns whenever an event happens. `VTPARSE_ACTION_PUT` and `VTPARSE_ACTION_PRINT` do not trigger an event for each character, instead the corresponding byte range in the input buffer is indicated.
* **Termination of OSC with BEL**<br/>Another DEC-incompatible xterm extension. This feature is e.g. used by `bash` to set the window title.


## How to use

### Initializing the parser

Use `void vtparse_init(vtparse_t *parser)` to initialize and reset the parser. Example:
```C
vtparse_t parser;
vtparse_init(&parser);
```

### Parsing a byte sequence

Use `unsigned int vtparse_parse(vtparse_t *parser, unsigned char *buf, unsigned int buf_len)` to parse a byte sequence. The function will return the number of bytes that were read from the input buffer. This value may be smaller than `buf_len` and even be equal to zero. However, this does not indicated an error, it just means that `vtparse_parse` needs to be called again with the `buf` pointer begin advanced by exactly this value. In fact, you should call `vtparse_parse` with a zero-length input buffer until `vtparse_has_event` returns `false`. For example:
```C
unsigned char buf[1024];
unsigned int buf_pos, did_read;
vtparse_t parser;
vtparse_init(&parser);
do {
	did_read = fread(buf, 1, sizeof(buf), stdin);
	buf_pos = 0;
	while (1) {
		buf_pos += vtparse_parse(&parser, buf + buf_pos, did_read - buf_pos);
		if (!vtparse_has_event(&parser)) {
			break; /* No event to print, exit loop */
		}

		/* We have an event, process */
		/* ... */
	}
} while (did_read > 0); /* Continue until EOF */
```

See `example/vtparse_example.c` for a complete example.

## Building

`vtparse` consists of two `.c` and `.h` files. It should correspondingly be quite straight-forward to integrate with your own project. Additionally, this project supports the Meson build system.

### Manual build

`vtparse` has zero dependencies; it solely consists of the files in the `vtparse` folder. You can for example compile the demo application by running
```
git clone https://github.com/astoeckel/vtparse
cd vtparse
gcc -std=c89 -Wall -o vtparse_example example/vtparse_example.c vtparse/vtparse.c vtparse/vtparse_table.c
echo -e "Hello\nWorld" ./vtparse_example
```

### Using meson

This project supports the Meson build system. To install Meson, run `pip3 install --user meson`. Meson furthermore depends on `ninja`. `ninja` (sometimes called `ninja-build`) should be provided by your Linux distribution. To build the library and run the tests run
```
git clone https://github.com/astoeckel/vtparse
cd vtparse && mkdir build && cd build
meson -Dbuildtype=release ..
ninja
ninja test
```
